# Photo-copy
A very primitive model of an image to text selection window.

## Setup
You will have to pytesseract installed, both the pip, and the exe. Then you will have to go into the main file and change the variable "pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd" to the path to your executable. 

I understand this is not ideal and I will be working on a solution to fix this, probably a different module. 

## Compatibility
Currently only supports Windows operating systems. This will be able to support all operating systems in the future.

## Known Issues
- Only supports windows operating systems
- Pytesseract path link 
- Selection window not optimized

I will be working on fixes for all of these, and there will definitely be more issues to come. If you would like to provide support, please do.
